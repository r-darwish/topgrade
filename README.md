Keeping your system up to date mostly involves invoking more than a single package manager. This
usually results in big shell one-liners saved in your shell history. Topgrade tries to solve this
problem by detecting which tools you use and run their appropriate package managers.

## Supported Platforms
Topgrade should probably work on whichever platform it can be build. The real question is whether
Topgrade knows that platform and can utilize its unique features, such as the operating system's
pacakge manager. Topgrade is tested on and knows the following platforms:

* Linux
  * Arch
  * CentOS/RHEL
  * Fedora
  * Debian/Ubuntu
  * Gentoo
  * openSUSE
  * Void
* FreeBSD
* macOS
* Windows

## Installation
Arch Linux users can use the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/topgrade/) package.

macOS users can install topgrade via Homebrew.

Other systems users can either use `cargo install` or use the compiled binaries from the release
page. The compiled binaries contain a self-upgrading feature.

Topgrade isn't guaranteed to work on Rust versions older than the latest stable release. If you
intend to install Topgrade using Cargo then you should either install Rust using rustup or use a
distribution which ships the latest version of Rust, such as Arch Linux.

## Usage
Just run `topgrade`. It will run the following steps:

* Try to self-upgrade if compiled with this feature. On Unix systems Topgrade will also respawn
  itself if it was upgraded
* **Linux**: Run the system package manager:
  * **Arch**: Run [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay) or fall back to pacman
  * **CentOS/RHEL**: Run `yum upgrade`
  * **Fedora**: Run `dnf upgrade`
  * **Debian/Ubuntu**: Run `apt update && apt dist-upgrade`
  * **Gentoo**: Run `layman -s ALL && emerge --sync -q && eix-update && emerge -uDNa world`
  * **openSUSE**: Run `zypper refresh && zypper dist-upgrade`
  * **Void**: Run `xbps-install -Su`
* **Linux**: Run [etc-update](https://dev.gentoo.org/~zmedico/portage/doc/man/etc-update.1.html):
* **FreeBSD**: Upgrade and audit packages
* **Unix**: Run `brew update && brew upgrade`. This should handle both Homebrew and Linuxbrew
* **Unix**: Run `nix upgrade-nix && nix --upgrade`.
* **Unix**: Run [Pearl](https://github.com/pearl-core/pearl) `pearl update`.
* **Windows**: Upgrade Powershell modules
* **Windows**: Upgrade all [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) packages
* **Windows**: Upgrade all [Scoop](https://scoop.sh) packages
* Check if the following paths are tracked by Git. If so, pull them:
  * ~/.emacs.d (Should work whether you use [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) or a custom configuration)
  * ~/.zshrc
  * [~/.oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
  * ~/.tmux
  * ~/.config/fish
  * ~/.config/nvim
  * ~/.vim
  * ~/.config/openbox
  * ~/.config/bspwm
  * ~/.config/i3
  * Powershell Profile
  * Custom defined paths
* **Unix**: Run [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug) update
* **Unix**: Run [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher)
* **Unix**: Upgrade tmux plugins with [TPM](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm). *Note*: Do not use
  the `-b` flag in your configuration as suggested by the TPM readme.
* Update Rustup by running `rustup update`. This will also attempt to run `rustup self update` when Rustup is installed inside the home directory.
* Run Cargo [install-update](https://github.com/nabijaczleweli/cargo-update)
* Upgrade Emacs packages (You'll get a better output if you have [Paradox](https://github.com/Malabarba/paradox) installed)
* Upgrade [OCaml packages](https://opam.ocaml.org/)
* Upgrade [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) globally installed packages
* Upgrade Python packages installed using [pipx](https://github.com/cs01/pipx)
* Upgrade [R globally installed packages](https://github.com/ankane/jetpack)
* Upgrade Vim/Neovim packages. Works with the following plugin frameworks:
  * [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim)
  * [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
  * [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
  * [Dein](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim)
* Node
  * Run `yarn global update` if yarn is installed.
  * Run `npm update -g` if NPM is installed and `npm root -g` is a path inside your home directory.
* Run `composer global update` if Composer's home directory is inside the home directory of the
  user. Run `valet install` after.
* Upgrade Atom packages
* Run `gem upgrade --user-install` if `~/.gem` exists
* **Linux**: Update Flatpak packages
* **Linux**: Update snap packages
* **Linux**: Run [fwupdmgr](https://github.com/hughsie/fwupd) to show firmware upgrade. (View
  only. No upgrades will actually be performed)
* Run custom defined commands
* Final stage
  * **Linux**: Run [needrestart](https://github.com/liske/needrestart)
  * **Windows**: Run Windows Update (You'll have to install [PSWindowsUpdate](https://marckean.com/2016/06/01/use-powershell-to-install-windows-updates/))
  * **macOS**: Upgrade App Store applications
  * **FreeBSD**: Run `freebsd-upgrade`

## Flags
* `-t/--tmux` - Topgrade will launch itself in a new tmux session. This flag has no effect if
  Topgrade already runs inside tmux. This is useful when using topgrade on remote systems.
* `-c/--cleanup` - Topgrade will instruct package managers to remove old or unused files
* `-n/--dry-run` - Print what should be run.
* `--disable [STEPS]` - Disable one or more steps:
  * `system` - Skip the system upgrade phase.
  * `git-repos` - Don't pull custom git repositories.
  * `emacs` - Don't upgrade Emacs packages or configuration files.
  * `vim` - Don't upgrade Vim/NeoVim packages or configuration files.
  * `gem` - Don't upgrade ruby gems.
* `--no-retry` - Don't ask to retry failed steps.

## Customization
Here's an example for a configuration file:


``` toml
git_repos = [
    "~/dev/topgrade",
]

# Same options as the command line flag
disable = ["system", "emacs"]

[pre_commands]
"Emacs Snapshot" = "rm -rf ~/.emacs.d/elpa.bak && cp -rl ~/.emacs.d/elpa ~/.emacs.d/elpa.bak"

[commands]
"Python Environment" = "~/dev/.env/bin/pip install -i https://pypi.python.org/simple -U --upgrade-strategy eager jupyter"
```
* `git_repos` - A list of custom Git repositories to pull
* `pre_commands` - Commands to execute before starting any action. If any command fails, Topgrade
  will not proceed
* `commands` - Custom upgrade steps. If any command fails it will be reported in the summary as all
  upgrade steps are reported, but it will not cause Topgrade to stop.

### Configuration path

The configuration should be placed in the following paths depending by the operating system:

* **macOS** - `~/Library/Preferences/topgrade.toml`
* **Windows** - `%APPDATA%/topgrade.toml`
* **Other Unix systems** - `~/.config/topgrade.toml`
