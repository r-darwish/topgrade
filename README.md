Keeping your system up to date usually involves invoking multiple package managers.
This results in big, non-portable shell one-liners saved in your shell.
To remedy this, _topgrade_ detects which tools you use and runs the appropriate commands to update them.

## Why this repo ?

This is a fork of the original project by r-darwish.

## Installation
- Arch Linux: [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/topgrade/) package.
- NixOS: _topgrade_ package in `nixpkgs`.
- macOS: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/install.php).

Other systems users can either use `cargo install` or use the compiled binaries from the release page.
The compiled binaries contain a self-upgrading feature.

Topgrade requires Rust 1.51 or above.

## Usage
Just run `topgrade`.
See [the wiki](https://github.com/r-darwish/topgrade/wiki/Step-list) for the list of things Topgrade supports.

## Customization
See `config.example.toml` for an example configuration file.

### Configuration path

The configuration should be placed in the following paths depending by the operating system:

* **Windows** - `%APPDATA%/topgrade.toml`
* **macOS** and **other Unix systems** - `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/topgrade.toml`

## Remote execution
You can specify a key called `remote_topgrades` in the configuration file.
This key should contain a list of hostnames that have topgrade installed on them.
Topgrade will use `ssh` to run `topgrade` on remote hosts before acting locally.
To limit the execution only to specific hosts use the `--remote-host-limit` parameter.
